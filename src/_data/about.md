# Hi! I'm **Alfie Atkinson** from the United Kingdom

## My Story

I've been passionate about programming since I first learned **Python** through [*Codecademy*](https://www.codecademy.com/) at 14. I started by making simple text-based adventure games about my friend's cat, Casper (*Super Casper*). A year later, I explored web development, learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create [*Fexal*](https://fexal.vercel.app) with my cousinâ€”an educational resource hub for GCSE sciences, featuring interactive games.  

During my **A-Levels**, I took Computer Science, where I deepened my understanding of OOP, algorithms, and software design. For my NEA (Non-Exam Assessment), I developed a procedurally generated 2D platformer in **Pygame**, called [*The Rapture*](https://github.com/alfieatkinson/The-Rapture), to apply my newfound skills.  

I went on to earn a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**, where I developed a [*Sentiment Analysis Tool*](https://github.com/alfieatkinson/sentiment-analysis-tool) as my dissertation project. After graduating, I completed a summer internship at [*B-Hive Innovations*](https://www.b-hiveinnovations.co.uk/), working in an **Agile** team on the **TuberScan Venture**. Now, I'm pursuing a **Master of Science in Computer Science**, to further refine my expertise.  

## Overview

I specialise in **full-stack software engineering**, primarily using **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Django**, **MySQL**, and the **MERN Stack**. I'm also expanding my skills in **TypeScript**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Next.js**.  

Additionally, I have strong experience in **DevOps** and software development best practices, including **Agile methodologies**, **CI/CD**, and the full **Software Development Life Cycle**. I'm proficient with tools like **Git**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **AWS**, and **Vercel/Heroku**.  

Beyond web development, my studies have given me a solid foundation in **C++**, **AI/ML**, **cyber security**, and **UI/UX**, which I continue to improve.

# Hi! I'm **Alfie Atkinson** from the United Kingdom

## My Journey

Iâ€™ve been obsessed with programming ever since I first learned **Python** at age 14 through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). My first project? A simple text-based adventure game about my friendâ€™s cat, Casper (*Super Casper*). From there, my curiosity led me to **web development**, and I created [Fexal](https://fexal.vercel.app) with my cousinâ€”a platform to help students with their GCSE sciences.

During my **A-Levels**, I delved deeper into the world of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, algorithms, and software design. I applied these skills by developing a procedurally generated 2D platformer, [The Rapture](https://github.com/alfieatkinson/The-Rapture), using **Pygame** for my NEA.

I earned a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**, where my dissertation project was the creation of a [Sentiment Analysis Tool](https://github.com/alfieatkinson/sentiment-analysis-tool) to analyse social media sentiment. After graduation, I embarked on an internship at [B-Hive Innovations](https://www.b-hiveinnovations.co.uk/), working in an **Agile** environment on the **TuberScan Venture** project.

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a **Master of Science in Computer Science**, pushing my boundaries even further. My current internship at [Synx Games](https://synx.games/) has me developing a new Roblox game from the ground up using **TypeScript** and **React**. It's an exciting project that blends creative thinking with technical expertise.

With my masterâ€™s degree set to complete in **September 2025**, Iâ€™m on the lookout for new opportunities in **full-stack development** or **software engineering** for when I graduate!

## What I Do

Iâ€™m passionate about **full-stack development**, with a focus on **Python** and **TypeScript**, working with the **MERN Stack** and **Django**. Iâ€™m always growing and currently expanding my expertise in **PostgreSQL** and **Next.js**. 

Beyond the web, I have a strong background in **DevOps**, **Agile methodologies**, and tools like **Git**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Azure**. Iâ€™ve also developed a strong foundation in **AI/ML**, **C++**, **cyber security**, and **UI/UX design** through my studies.
